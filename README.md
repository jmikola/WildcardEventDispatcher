# WildcardEventDispatcher

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jmikola/WildcardEventDispatcher.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jmikola/WildcardEventDispatcher)

This library implements an event dispatcher, based on [Symfony2's interface][],
with wildcard syntax inspired by AMQP topic exchanges. Listeners may be bound to
a wildcard pattern and be notified if a dispatched event's name matches that
pattern. Literal event name matching is still supported.

If you are interested in using this library in a Symfony2 project, you may also
want to take a look at the corresponding [bundle][].

  [Symfony2's interface]: https://github.com/symfony/EventDispatcher
  [bundle]: https://github.com/jmikola/JmikolaWildcardEventDispatcherBundle

### Install

The package can be installed using [ Composer ](https://getcomposer.org/).
Add the package to your `composer.json`.

```
"require": {
    "jmikola/wildcard-event-dispatcher" : "1.*",
}
```

## Usage ##

WildcardEventDispatcher implements EventDispatcherInterface and may be used as
you would Symfony2's standard EventDispatcher:

```php
<?php

use Jmikola\WildcardEventDispatcher\WildcardEventDispatcher;
use Symfony\Component\EventDispatcher\Event;

$dispatcher = new WildcardEventDispatcher();
$dispatcher->addListener('core.*', function(Event $e) {
    echo $e->getName();
});
$dispatcher->dispatch('core.request');

// "core.request" will be printed
```

Internally, WildcardEventDispatcher actually [composes][] an
EventDispatcherInterface instance, which it relies upon for event handling. By
default, WildcardEventDispatcher will construct an EventDispatcher object for
internal use, but you may specify a particular EventDispatcherInterface instance
to wrap in the constructor:

```php
<?php

use Jmikola\WildcardEventDispatcher\WildcardEventDispatcher;
use Symfony\Component\EventDispatcher\EventDispatcher;

$dispatcher = new WildcardEventDispatcher(new EventDispatcher());
```

## Wildcard Syntax ##

### Single-word Wildcard ###

Consider the scenario where the same listener is defined for multiple events,
all of which share a common prefix:

```php
<?php

$coreListener = function(Event $e) {};

$dispatcher = new WildcardEventDispatcher();
$dispatcher->addListener('core.exception', $coreListener);
$dispatcher->addListener('core.request', $coreListener);
$dispatcher->addListener('core.response', $coreListener);
```

These event names all consist of two dot-separated words. This concept of a word
will be important in understanding how wildcard patterns apply.

In this example, the listener is responsible for observing all `core` events in
the application. Let's suppose it needs to log some details about these events
to an external server. We can refactor multiple `addListener()` calls by
using the single-word `*` wildcard:

```php
<?php

$coreListener = function(Event $e) {};

$dispatcher = new WildcardEventDispatcher();
$dispatcher->addListener('core.*', $coreListener);
```

The listener will now observe all events named `core` or starting with `core.`
and followed by another word. The matching of `core` alone may not make sense,
but this is implemented in order to be consistent with AMQP. A trailing `*`
after a non-empty sequence may match the preceding sequence sans `.*`.

### Multi-word Wildcard ###

Suppose there was a `core` event in your application named `core.foo.bar`. The
aforementioned `core.*` pattern would not catch this event. You could use:

```php
<?php

$coreListener = function(Event $e) {};

$dispatcher = new WildcardEventDispatcher();
$dispatcher->addListener('core.*.*', $coreListener);
```

This syntax would match `core.foo` and `core.foo.bar`, but `core` would no
longer be matched (assuming there was such an event).

The multi-word `#` wildcard might be more appropriate here:

```php
<?php

$coreListener = function(Event $e) {};

$dispatcher = new WildcardEventDispatcher();
$dispatcher->addListener('core.#', $coreListener);
```

Suppose there was also an listener in the application that needed to listen on
_all_ events in the application. The multi-word `#` wildcard could be used:

```php
<?php

$allListener = function(Event $e) {};

$dispatcher = new WildcardEventDispatcher();
$dispatcher->addListener('#', $allListener);
```

### Additional Wildcard Documentation ###

When in doubt, the unit tests for `ListenerPattern` are a good resource for
inferring how wildcards will be interpreted. This library aims to mimic the
behavior of AMQP topic wildcards completely, but there may be shortcomings.
